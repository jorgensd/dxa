# # Inverting for a source term from point measurements
# *Section author: Henrik Finsberg ([henriknf@simula.no](mailto:henriknf@simula.no))*.

# The [Poisson mother problem](./poisson_mother.py) demo matches the computed state against a
# desired profile known *everywhere* in the domain. Real data is rarely like that: sensors sit
# at a handful of locations, wells are drilled at specific coordinates, and medical images
# sample the domain on their own grid rather than on the finite element mesh.

# This demo solves the same mother problem, but against data that only exists at **points**.
# The tool for that is `dolfinx_adjoint.PointObservation`, which evaluates a finite element
# function at a given set of coordinates,
#
# $$
# d = B u, \qquad B_{ij} = \phi_j(x_i),
# $$
#
# so that row $i$ picks out the value of $u$ at the point $x_i$. Together with a PDE solve,
# $m \mapsto B u(m)$ is what is known as the *parameter-to-observable map*.

# ## Problem definition
# We recover an unknown source $f$ from noisy measurements of the state at a set of sensor
# locations. The state solves
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# -\Delta u &= f && \text{in } \Omega, \\
# u &= 0 && \text{on } \partial\Omega,
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# and we minimize
#
# $$
# \min_{f} J(f) = \frac{1}{2} \lVert B u(f) - d \rVert^2
#              + \frac{\alpha}{2} \int_\Omega f^2 ~\mathrm{d}x.
# $$
#
# The first term is a sum over the sensors rather than an integral over $\Omega$. The data is
# never interpolated onto the mesh, so nothing is invented at locations where nothing was
# measured -- which matters, because interpolating sparse data onto a fine mesh manufactures
# exactly the information the inverse problem is supposed to extract.

# The residual settles *at* the noise floor rather than below it. That is the outcome to hope
# for: driving it to zero would mean fitting the noise, and the regularization term is what
# stops that from happening.
#
# The recovered source is a smoothed version of the truth, with lower peaks than the real
# bumps. That is not a defect of the method but a property of the data: a few hundred
# measurements of a smoothing operator's output do not determine the fine structure of the
# source, and the regularization supplies what the data cannot.
