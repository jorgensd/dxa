# Original implementation in [dolfin-adjoint](https://github.com/dolfin-adjoint/dolfin-adjoint) was by Simon W. Funke.

# This demo solves the *mother problem* of PDE-constrained optimization: the optimal control of the Possion equation.
# Physically, this problem can be interpreted as finding the best heating/cooling of a cooktop to achieve a desired temperature profile.

# This example introduces the basics of how to solve optimization problems with DOLFINx-adjoint.

# ## Problem definition
# Mathematically, the goal is to minimize the following tracking type functional:
#
# $$
# \min_{f \in Q} J(u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} (u - d)^2 ~\mathrm{d}x + \frac{\alpha}{2}\int_{\Omega} f^2~\mathrm{d} x
# $$
# 
# subject to the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
# - \kappa \Delta u &= f  && \text{in } \Omega, \\
# u &= 0 && \text{on } \partial\Omega, \\
# a &\leq f \leq b &&
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# where $\Omega$ is the domain of interest, $u: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is the unknown temperature,
# $\kappa\in\mathbb{R}$ is the thermal diffusivity, $f: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is the unknown contrl function acting as a source term,
# $d:\Omega\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is the desired temperature profile, and $\alpha\in[0,\infty)$ is a Tikhonov regularization parameter,
# and $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ are the lower and upper bounds on the control function $f$. 
# Note that $f(x)>0$ corresponds to heating, while $f(x)<0$ corresponds to cooling.

# It can be shown that this problem is well-posed and has a unique solution, see for instance Section 1.5 {cite}`Ulbrich2009` or {cite}`troltzsch2010optimal`.
