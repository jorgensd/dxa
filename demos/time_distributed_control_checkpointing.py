# # Time-distributed control with checkpointing
#
# This is the [time-distributed control](./time_distributed_control.py) demo again, with
# checkpointing switched on.
#
# Taping a time-dependent model keeps every intermediate state alive, because the adjoint
# sweep needs each of them on the way back. For a long simulation that is the thing that
# exhausts memory first. Checkpointing trades that memory for repeated work: only some states
# are kept, and the rest are recomputed from the nearest stored one when the adjoint asks for
# them. A schedule decides which to keep and when to recompute. The schedules come from
# `checkpoint_schedules` {cite}`tdcc-Dolci2024`; for how step-based checkpointing combines
# with high-level algorithmic differentiation, see {cite}`tdcc-Maddison2024`.
#
# Everything here comes from `pyadjoint` and `checkpoint_schedules` directly. The only thing
# `dolfinx_adjoint` adds is `enable_disk_checkpointing`, used at the end.
