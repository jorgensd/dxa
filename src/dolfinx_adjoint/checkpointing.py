"""Snapshot checkpointing of DOLFINx functions to disk.

A checkpoint schedule that uses {py:class}`checkpoint_schedules.schedule.StorageType` ``DISK`` needs somewhere
to put a function's values. This module provides that as a *snapshot* checkpoint: it is written
and read within a single run, by the same processes, against an unchanged mesh and partition.
Under those assumptions the whole payload is a process's local values, so no mesh, geometry or
permutation data is stored and the file is a flat array per stored value. Ghost values are
stored alongside the owned ones, which keeps restoring free of communication -- see `_layout`.

Snapshot checkpoints are therefore not portable. They cannot be reopened by a later run, or on a
different number of processes. For a checkpoint that outlives the run, use {py:mod}`io4dolfinx`.
